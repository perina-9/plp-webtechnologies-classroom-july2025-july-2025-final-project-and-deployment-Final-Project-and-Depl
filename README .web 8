🧭 Part 1: Planning and Organizing a Multipage Website
✅ Define Your Website's Purpose.
📄 Pages Outline
Here’s a solid 5-page structure:
| Page | Purpose | 
| Home | Welcome message, brief intro, featured projects | 
| About | Personal bio, skills, experience | 
| Projects | Gallery or list of work with descriptions | 
| Contact | Form for inquiries, social links | 
| Blog | Optional: share thoughts, tutorials, updates | 


🧱 Layout Description
Each page will share a consistent layout:
- Header: Logo + navigation menu
- Main Content: Page-specific sections
- Footer: Copyright, social media icons
🔗 Internal Navigation Map
Use a <nav> element with links like:
<nav>
  <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  <a href="about.html">About</a>
  <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>
  <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
  <a href="blog.html">Blog</a>
</nav>


Use relative paths and ensure each page links back to the others.

💻 Part 2: Build the Website Using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
🧩 HTML5 Structure
Use semantic tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, and <article>.
🎨 CSS Styling
- Use Flexbox/Grid for layout
- Add media queries for responsiveness
- Include transitions or keyframe animations for hover effects, scroll reveals, etc.
⚙️ JavaScript Interactivity
Each page should include at least one interactive feature:
| Page | Interactive Element | 
| Home | Toggle theme (light/dark) | 
| About | Skill progress bars animated on scroll | 
| Projects | Filterable gallery | 
| Contact | Form validation | 
| Blog | Expand/collapse posts or comments |

🧼 Clean Code Tips
- Use consistent indentation
- Comment sections clearly
- Use descriptive class and ID names
- Validate HTML/CSS with W3C Validator
📱 Responsive Testing
Test on:
- Chrome DevTools (mobile view)
- Real devices (phone/tablet)
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

🚀 Part 4: Hosting and Deployment
🧭 Choose a Hosting Platform
- GitHub Pages: Great for static sites. Just push your repo and enable Pages.
- Netlify: Drag-and-drop or connect GitHub repo. Supports forms and CI/CD.
- Vercel: Ideal for frontend frameworks, but works great for static HTML too.
✅ Deployment Checklist
- All links work
- No broken images or scripts
- Mobile layout looks good
- Shareable URL (e.g., yourname.github.io/portfolio)
